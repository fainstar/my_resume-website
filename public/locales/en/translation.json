    "description": "I am a developer who loves technology, focusing on frontend and full-stack development.",
    "bio": "I initially learned Minecraft Server on my own because I wanted to play games with friends, which introduced me to server architecture and network technology for the first time. Before encountering IoT in high school classes, I developed a deep interest in technology and began learning about frontend and backend development.\n\nIn this process, I mastered Django and Flask for backend development, and used React, Swift, and Flutter for frontend development. I also used Nginx to name websites and AWS to build a real-time video streaming service platform. Additionally, I used Docker to containerize applications to improve development and deployment efficiency.\n\nIn competitions, I was mainly responsible for IoT-related circuit design and program development, such as power supply solutions and relay control. In the future, I would like to develop smart applications that combine IoT and AI to solve real problems, and deepen my research on high-performance backend architecture and distributed system technologies."
